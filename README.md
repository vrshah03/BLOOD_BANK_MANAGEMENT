# BLOOD_BANK_MANAGEMENT

The purpose of the Blood Bank Management System is to answer or address the needs of every issue happening in the blood bank. The problems could include difficulty in tracing their donors, managing blood bank accounts, and addressing the efficiency of doing transactions in hospitals. 

The Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is a website that stores, processes, retrieves, and analyzes data about blood bank administration. It also supervises blood inventory management and other blood bank-related activities.

The major goal of the blood bank management system is to keep track of blood, donors, blood groups, blood banks, and stock information. It keeps track of all information concerning blood, blood cells, stocks, and blood. Because the project is all done at the administrative level, only the administrator can see it.

## DONOR_MODEL
Donors can log in and register with basic information on our website. Donors can donate the different types of blood which are available. Donors can request to administrative for donating blood and also make a request for blood as patients.

## PATIENT_MPDEL
Patients can log in and register with basic information on our website. The patient can request blood for which they are in need of.

## ADMIN_MODEL
The administrative has all the rights. Administrative can accept the donor's request if the donor's data match the criteria and if the donor has no disease; otherwise, the administrative can reject the request made by the donor. 
Administrative can accept the request made by the patient if there is bloodstock available in the blood bank.
Administrative can contact the other blood bank and update the bloodstock.
